# Incorporating Isoprene Emissions into the P-Model for Vegetation Productivity

This repository contains the code, data, and results for my master's thesis, which explores the incorporation of isoprene emissions into the P-model for vegetation productivity. The repository is organized into three main folders:

### Code

The **code** folder contains all of the code used in my analysis, including scripts for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and model development. The code is written in Python, Bash, and R. The code references the folders below. 

### Data

The **data** folder contains all of the raw data used in my analysis, as well as intermediate datasets generated during the analysis. However, for storage purposes this folder is ignored in github. You can acsess the datasets here (insert the link to all of the data) 

### Results

The results folder contains the results generated during my analysis, including figures, tables, and statistical outputs. Intermediate and large results are ignored. 

### Usage

To reproduce the results of my analysis, download the required data to your PC as described in the README for the **data** folder, download this repository and run the scripts in the **code** folder in the order specified in the README files within **code**. The scripts are designed to be run in order, and each script will generate the necessary inputs for the subsequent script. The results will be saved in the **results** folder.
